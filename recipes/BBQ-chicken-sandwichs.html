    <p> Hello Fresh's recipe for a Super quick BBQ chicken sandwich</p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>310g Chicken Breast Tenders OR 2 Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li>2 Artisan Bun</li>
        <li>4 tbsp BBQ Sauce</li>
        <li>170g Coleslaw Cabbage Mix</li>
        <li>4 tbsp Ranch Dressing</li>
        <li>1 tbsp BBQ Seasoning</li>
        <li>90 ml Dill Pickle, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with foil. Pat <strong> chicken </strong> dry with paper towels, then add to prepared sheet. Season with <strong>BBQ Seasoning</strong> and <strong>pepper</strong>, then drizzle 1/2 tbsp oil over top. Toss to coat. Broil in the middle of the oven until cooked through, 9-11mins</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pour <strong>pickle brine</strong> into large bowl. Finely chop half the pickle slices. Set remaining pickle slices aside for serving. Add <strong> ranch dressing, chopped pickles and coleslaw cabbage mix</strong> to bowl with pickle brine. Season with salt and pepper, then toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Halve Buns. While chicken broils, arrange buns directly on top rack of the oven, cut-sides up. Toast until golden, 1-2 mins.</li>
        <li>When chicken is cooked through, carefully remove from the oven. Drizzle BBQ sauce over top, then toss to coat. If desired, return to oven to warm BBQ sauce through.</li>
        <li>Stack chicken and any remaining sauce from baking sheet on bottom buns. Add pickle slices. Add coleslaw to sandwichs, if desired. Close with top buns. Divide sandwichs, slaw and remaining pickles between plates</li>
    </ol>
